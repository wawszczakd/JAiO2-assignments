# JAiO2 Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to assignments from the course "Languages,
Automata Theory, and Theory of Computation II."

## Overview

JAiO stands for "Języki, Automaty i Obliczenia" in Polish, which translates to
"Languages, Automata Theory, and Theory of Computation." This is the second,
optional part of the course. It covers various advanced topics, such as Vector
Addition Systems, Tarski Arithmetic, Infinite Games, Weighted Automata, and
more. There were three assignments in total, each consisting of a few
theoretical problems. Problem statements and solutions are in English and
provided as PDFs generated with LaTeX.

## Assignment Topics

The assignments cover the following topics:

1. $\omega$-words, well-quasi orders, Higman's Lemma, first-order logic
2. Weighted automata, polynomial automata
3. Register automata, $\omega$-regular languages, Büchi automata

The solutions can be found in the respective directories. Unfortunately, I did
not manage to solve the third problem from the first assignment.
